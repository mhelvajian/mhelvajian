Hi, I’m @mhelvajian. These projects showcase a bit of what I've been doing with Python to perform data analysis and transformation. 
I tend to write scripts to do some very specific data manipulation to meet a business problem that would be prohibitively 
time consuming to solve manually. 
If you like what you're seeing I can be contacted through LinkedIn:
Thanks for stopping by!
